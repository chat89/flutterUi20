# Weather App - Full Flutter Project (Option B)

This project is an original Flutter UI implementation of a weather app inspired by the provided Figma design.
It was created specifically for your assignment (Option B: recreate UI without embedding Figma artwork).

## What is included
- Complete `lib/` source with provider-based structure.
- `assets/images/` folder containing placeholder images so assets folder is not empty.
- Platform folders: `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` with README placeholders (regenerate via `flutter create .` if you need full platform build files).
- `test/` folder with a basic example test.
- `pubspec.yaml` and `.gitignore`.

## How to run
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Extract the zip and open the project folder in Android Studio or VS Code.
3. If you need full native platform files, run (optional): `flutter create .` to regenerate `android/` and `ios/` build files.
4. Run `flutter pub get`.
5. Run `flutter run` on an emulator or device.

## Notes about originality
- All Dart code in `lib/` is original and written specifically for this assignment.
- Placeholder images are simple, generated here to avoid any copyrighted third-party assets.
- To use your Figma artwork, export images from Figma and place them into `assets/images/`.
